# Android-Projects-with-Java
#    A list of android app projects i made with Java

My first experience with android development was with Python and to be more precisely with kivy framework(which is 

fantastic but not the best for a beginner), so i wanted to learn and understand what makes Java better than Python in 

android development,also to learn in depths the Java language.

For the projects besides the Java language i also used Android Studio for development which is awesome.
